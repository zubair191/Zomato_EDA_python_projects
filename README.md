# Zomato Dataset Analysis Project

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze the Zomato dataset to gain insights into various factors affecting the aggregate rating of each restaurant, the establishment of different types of restaurants at different locations, and more. 

## Project Overview
Bengaluru, being one such city under study, boasts over 12,000 restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. Despite the increasing demand and the continuous emergence of new restaurants, the industry remains unsaturated. However, new entrants often face challenges in competing with established restaurants, many of which serve similar food offerings. 

## Bengaluru's Culinary Landscape
Bengaluru, being the IT capital of India, witnesses a significant reliance on restaurant food due to time constraints preventing individuals from cooking at home. Understanding the overwhelming demand for restaurants, it becomes crucial to delve into the demography of each location. This analysis aims to uncover preferences for certain types of cuisine within localities, such as the popularity of vegetarian food. Additionally, it explores whether specific localities are predominantly inhabited by particular communities, such as Jains, Marwaris, or Gujaratis, who often prefer vegetarian options.

## Project Scope
By leveraging the Zomato dataset, this project intends to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing restaurant ratings and preferences in Bengaluru. Through data-driven insights, it aims to provide valuable information for restaurant owners, investors, and policymakers to better understand consumer behavior and market dynamics.
